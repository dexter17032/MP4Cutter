# MP4Cutter (Java)

MP4Cutter is a basic Java tool built to parse `.mp4` file atoms/boxes like `ftyp`, `moov`, `mdhd`, and more. It was primarily created as a learning project to better understand the MP4 file structure and binary file handling in Java.

## Project Status

This project is currently inactive. Development was last active around 4â€“5 months ago. The tool is not abandoned, but it is not being actively worked on at the moment. Editing or modifying MP4 content is out of scope for now, i yet havent figured out a way to parse and store nested atoms.

## Features

- Parses basic MP4 atoms including:
  - `ftyp`
  - `moov`
  - `mvhd`
  - `tkhd`
- Uses standard Java file I/O (no external libraries)

## Limitations

- Does not support editing or modifying MP4 files
- Does not cut or trim videos
- Does not parse all atom types
- No graphical interface
- Not production-ready

## Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- Plain Java I/O with `FileInputStream`, `DataInputStream`, etc.
